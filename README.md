# cs280_project
Intro to Data Science project:

The final project for this class involves an analysis of a dataset of our team's choosing. This project intends to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond) and apply them to a novel dataset meaningfully.

Our main goal is to prove that:

	We are proficient at asking meaningful questions and answering them with the results of fundamental data analysis and visualization,
	We are skilled in using Python and manipulating data frames,
	We are adept at creating visualizations with Seaborn,
	We can apply statistics (simulate to test hypotheses, find confidence intervals, use regression) and
	We can tell a cohesive story when you present your results.

Overarching Question:
What factors in a video game are associated with high critic and high user scores?

5 Mature Questions:
Are Nintendo games rated higher by critics over other publishers? Are they rated higher by users as well?
Have video game sales increased over time within each region with the increase of games available globally?
Do action games sell more copies (based on sales) than sports games, regardless of publisher? -> hypothesis test with shuffling of genre
Which platform gets a higher rating with critics, with users?
Do critics rate games higher than users or vice versa?
Which region has the highest volume of video games sold?

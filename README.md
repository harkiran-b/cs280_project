# cs280_project
Intro to Data Science project:

The final project for this class involves an analysis of a dataset of our team's choosing. This project intends to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond) and apply them to a novel dataset meaningfully.

Our main goal is to prove that:

	We are proficient at asking meaningful questions and answering them with the results of fundamental data analysis and visualization,
	We are skilled in using Python and manipulating data frames,
	We are adept at creating visualizations with Seaborn,
	We can apply statistics (simulate to test hypotheses, find confidence intervals, use regression) and
	We can tell a cohesive story when you present your results.
